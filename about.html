      <h2>Gurpreet Luthra</h2>

      <p>
        I am a passionate developer, technologist, learner and a software craftsman. I look
        for ways to use technology, to make a difference. I love converting the complex, to the simple.

      <p>
        Some folks say that I do have a rather curious knack to make connections between the programming world and
        the one we physically inhabit. I think they might be right.
