        <i>I am currenty focussing my energies towards Social Impact, Open Source, Public Health, <a href="http://www.bahmni.org"> Bahmni</a> and related areas of Tech4Good, with the hope that all I do helps make the world a better place.</i>

        In 2 years at <a href="http://tavisca.com/">tavisca</a>, Pune (2018-2020), I played the role of the Head of Product Practice, where I focussed towards instilling a culture of excellence in Product design and development. tavisca (and its parent company <a href="http://cxloyalty.com/default.aspx">cxLoyalty</a>) is in the business of Customer Loyalty & Engagement, with a focus towards Platform-as-a-Product for the Travel domain. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been with <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> for 7+ years. At ThoughtWorks, as a software craftsman and technical consultant I helped teams and organisations
        apply principles of Continuous Delivery and Extreme Programming (XP) to solve problems and delight customers.
      </p>

      <p>

        Earlier, I was also the Product Manager & Community Lead for <a href="http://www.bahmni.org"> Bahmni </a> -
        an Open Source Hospital Management system created by ThoughtWorks.
        In this role, I worked towards helping shape the roadmap for Bahmni and evangelising Open Source software
        for humanitarian purposes.

      </p>

      <p>
        Within ThoughtWorks I have worked on large-scale Web projects in Travel, Health, Retail and Consumer Electronics domains.
        I am passionate about product development, tech writing, teaching and using technology for social good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some folks say that I do have a rather curious knack to make connections between the programming world and
        the one we physically inhabit. I think they might be right.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also enjoy drawing comics on life, health and work. Check them out on my instagram page here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/insta.g9/">insta.g9</a>.
