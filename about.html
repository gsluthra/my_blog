      <p>
        I work at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> -
        an amazing, vibrant and fun place.
      </p>

      <p>

        As a software craftsman and technical consultant I help teams and organisations
        apply principles of Continuous Delivery and Extreme Programming (XP) to solve problems and delight customers.
      </p>

      <p>

        Earlier, I was also the Product Manager & Community Lead for <a href="http://www.bahmni.org"> Bahmni </a> -
        an Open Source Hospital Management system created by ThoughtWorks.
        In this role, I worked towards helping shape the roadmap for Bahmni and evangelising Open Source software
        for humanitarian purposes.

      </p>

      <p>
        Within ThoughtWorks I have worked on large-scale Web projects in Travel, Health, Retail and Consumer Electronics domains.
        I am passionate about product development, tech writing, teaching and using technology for social good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some folks say that I do have a rather curious knack to make connections between the programming world and
        the one we physically inhabit. I think they might be right.
