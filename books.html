                <h3>Zen and the Art of Motorcyle Maintenance (Robert M Pirsig)</h3>
                <i>
                One of my most loved books. I bought the Kindle reader just so that this book was with me at all times. This book is a story of a
                father and son trip across the US on a motorcyle. While riding, the father (narrator) muses about craftsmanship, quality, life, motorcycles, our current education system, and many other topics. Every read of this book gives new insights. You won't believe this book was first published in 1974! It is truly timeless and has a cult following.

                <h3>Anti-Fragile (Nassim Taleb)</h3>
                <i>
                    This book dives deep into the concept of Anti-fragility, i.e. systems which are the opposite of fragile -- get stronger with disorder & stress. Very fascinating! Once you understand the underlying principles of anti-fragile systems, one starts noticing their existence in many areas around us. A property of anti-fragile systems is that they sacrifice a small component for the protection of the whole -- for instance in body-building where you break down muscles under controlled stress and grow newer & stronger ones, or how horizontal-scaling strategy in a network of machines involves sacrifice of commodity hardware while making the whole system resilent.

The leading character, Nicholai has a very interesting personality, as a warrior and Go master. Since I like the game of Go, the references to Go game strategy and life are quite insightful.
