## Introduction

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based blog of Gurpreet.


## Ruby and RVM

This project already contains a `.ruby-gemset` and `.ruby-version` file,
to ensure that if you have RVM installed, then it will install gems
in the right directory, and give you a unique gemset.

## Installation & Usage

    bundle install

    # See blog locally on port 4000
    bundle exec jekyll serve

    # See blog locally on port 4000 (with drafts)
    bundle exec jekyll serve --draft

    # Command used by Github to build. Use this to verify if there are any errors
    bundle exec jekyll build --safe

## Publish to Github Pages

    # Create a local gh-pages branch which contains only the assets that need to be published
    JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec rake site:publish

    # Switch to this new branch
    git checkout gh-pages

    # FORCE Push the gh-branch to MASTER branch of your github.io repository assuming the remote name is 'website'
    git push website gh-pages:master --force

    # Once successfully published, tag the current branch
    git checkout -b gh-pages-release-x

    # Delete the local gh-pages branch.. since we don't need it anymore
    git branch -D gh-pages

    # Push backup to github
    git push origin gh-pages-release-x
