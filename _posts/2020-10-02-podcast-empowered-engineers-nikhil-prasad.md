### Nikhil Prasad - Cultivating an Empowered Engineering Culture
In this third episode of [_Expertease_](https://anchor.fm/expertease), we have a insightful chat with [Nikhil Prasad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilprasad/?originalSubdomain=in), CTO and co-founder of [tavisca](https://tavisca.com), a 700 people, product company, that is considered to be a strong people-centric organisation in Pune.

Nikhil talks about...

**>** _"If the why is ambitious & empowering, then it adds Purpose to the mission. And people need a purpose to be motivated."_


**>** _"A fresher on your team, who likely doesn't understand how company economics work, is not going to be motivated by a mission to triple your revenue."_

**>** _"Someone who has done fire-fighting due to bad code, will have a much stronger opinion about how to write code well, than someone who had just read it from a Design Pattern book."_

**>** _"Once an engineer sees how a casual decision in code, has created a scalability problem in production, they gain an unforgettable experience for life."_

**>** _"If you say you  are autonomous, but you penalise the first person that fails, 
  then guess what  -- people are not going to pick, being autonomous, any more."_ 

This is a really thought provoking episode that explains how Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose can act as foundational pillars on which an organisation can create an empowering engineering culture. 

**Episode Length: 53 mins (Part 1)**
