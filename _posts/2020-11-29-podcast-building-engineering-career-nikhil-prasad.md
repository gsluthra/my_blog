Nikhil talks about...

**>** _"The difference between using the term Developer vs an Engineer"_

**>** _"Should developers do testing?"_

**>** _"My mental models as a CTO to make effective decisions"_

**>** _"The Japanese concept of craftsmanship called Shokunin"_

**>** _"All amazing engineers I know have worked in the trenches"_

**>** _"The importance of having a set of distilled principles that allow you to charter unknown waters"_

This is a frank conversation with Nikhil, where he explains how one can be happy, by not necessarily having a _blinders on_ focus to climbing a career ladder, but instead focusing on learning, impact and the joy of building something wonderful -- while picking varied and end-to-end experience in software from design-to-maintenance.

**Episode Length: 42 mins (Part 2)**
