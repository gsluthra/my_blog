### Sandeep Nanu - Exiting the Rat Race
In this second episode of [_Expertease_](https://anchor.fm/expertease), we have a spirited chat with [Sandeep Nanu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepnanu/?originalSubdomain=in), serial entrepreneur and founder of a brand and communication consulting firm [WriteClick](https://writeclick.in/).

Sandeep talks about his first job as a WebDesigner and the lessons he learnt there, including the important of respecting your commitments to other and their time. We discuss his first company, CBeyond -- his challenges in dealing with large corporations and his motivation to instead find a better way to work sustainably, which led him to start WriteClick eventually in 2010.

This is a really fun episode, which gives an insight into how Sandeep has prioritized living a fulfilling life over running a rat race. I love his principles!
