My blog on Google Blogspot [techie-notebook.blogspot.in](http://techie-notebook.blogspot.in) hit the 100,000 views mark.
I am super excited. But, I didn't really like the way my blog looked. I wanted it to be simple. I wanted it to be
elegant. I wanted to render code, like it should. I wanted the programmer in me, to be in control. So I moved to
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Moving forward, I will write my lessons, and thoughts here; and [life-lessons.in](http://life-lessons.in) will its home.
I hope my blog readers will appreciate the move.
