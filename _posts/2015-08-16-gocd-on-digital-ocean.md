Today I experimented with installing ThoughtWorks GoCD Server and agent on a Digital Ocean CentOS droplet. 
Note that you will need to ensure that you setup [swap space on your digital ocean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-centos-6),
before proceeding with installing GoCD. 

Read the steps here on my old blog: [Installing ThoughtWorks GoCD Server and Agent on Digital Ocean Droplet](http://techie-notebook.blogspot.com/2015/08/installing-thoughtworks-go-server-agent.html).
