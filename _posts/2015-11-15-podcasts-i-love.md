Driving in India is a test of patience. And a waste of time.

A few months ago, I decided to try an experiment while driving to office (about a 30 minutes ride one way).
Podcasts.

Turns out, I had uncovered something amazing. Podcasts made me forget the time I spend on the road, and instead opened a window to a world I didn't know existed.
I now found an opportunity to hear interviews and stories, of lives of people, in far away places.
People, whose stories, I would otherwise never have heard.


He is a list (I plan to keep up-to-date), with a list of podcasts I really enjoyed, or were super thought-provoking. If you like these, please bookmark this post.
