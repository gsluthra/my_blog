Velocity! It's a term that has potentially confounded, frustrated and perhaps amused Agile practitioners and customers alike at some point. It's a concept that can be quite helpful though, when used accurately as a planning & estimation tool.

_Velocity is a measure of the number of story points delivered in an Iteration_. The word **delivered** here means - dev & test complete, and
ready for Production. Depending on your organizational maturity it could also mean -- **in Production**.


### Velocity as a Guide

Let's take an example of how one uses velocity as a guiding metric.

For instance, in Iteation-1 (I-1), if a team completes 12 story points, then the velocity of the team is 12. It means that, in next iteration you can assume the team will be able to deliver about 12 points worth of features. Another way of saying this, is that "yesterday's weather" is 12.

In I-2, if the team delivers 15 points, then for I-3 you can plan for approx 13 (avg of I-1 and I-2). On the other hand, if the team delivers say 10 points in I-2, then next time you plan for 11 (avg of I-1 and I-2).

In general, you average the velocity of the last three iterations, and use that as "_Yesterday's Weather_" to arrive at what you should expect as velocity for the next iteration.

### Low Velocity

If the team achieves lesser points in an iteration than what you expected, should you be concerned? The answer is: "_It depends_". You should try
and find out the possible cause, and then decide whether you should be concerned or not. _The aim is to reach a sustainable cadence
that allows for healthy team productivity and great customer satisfaction_.

A retrospective meeting at the end of an Iteration, is a great way to discuss potential reasons for drop (or increase in velocity). Some possible reasons for a drop in velocity are:

1. The features being developed were more complex than estimated (or expected).
2. High technical debt in certain parts of the system is causing development to be slower than expected. Think of Tech debt as hurdles on your way. The more the hurdles, the higher the friction, the slower you will move.
3. Other factors like too many red builds, flaky acceptance tests, network issues, unnecessary meetings, bugs from previous iteration, or holidays; could have sucked away precious time from the team -- and hence they could not work on feature development "_as much as they otherwise would_".

Usually a drop in velocity is due to a combination of the above factors. You may be able to remove some hurdles, and mitigate some challenges. Or, maybe, you can't do anything about some of the reasons. You note them down, voice them, and remember to account for them in future iteration plans where applicable.


### The "Upper Management" Effect

Many teams (and managers) don't want to show a velocity drop. Because _Upper Management_ will frown upon them as an indicator of _slacking_
and _under achievement_.

This leads to people coming up with various ways of showing that their velocity is the _same_ as before.
For instance, claims like: _we were busy refactoring the service layer, so, we should claim 2 points for that_. Or, _we were blocked due to
network issues, and hence we claim 1 point for that_. So now, with these deviations, total velocity is shown to be:

**9**  (actual for feature development) + **2**(for refactoring) + **1** (for network issues) = **12** (hey.. this is 1 point better than usual! All is good!)

This velocity adjustment for _upper management_ sake is a recipe for disaster. Because instead of fixing organizational, technical and business issues, we have made everything look "OK" and reached a status-quo.

The fixation for treating velocity as a productivity measure, has led to a loss of agility and muddled priorities.


### High Performance Teams & Trust

Agile practices only work when you trust the team. Trust can only be developed, when you hire the right people for the job. The right people for the job are people who care about their work, and are good at what they do. Organizations have a duty to hire the best, and then get out of the way, whilst providing periodic and necessary support.

Velocity as a metric, will be useful only if the team is passionate about delivering and improving their own productivity. If the team is looking at answering the question - "How can we do better?", then velocity can help the team to inform them if they are on the right track.

 But, depending ONLY on "_velocity_" as a measure of your improvement is wrong. You may see a drop in _velocity_ due to many external factors, even when the team is taking the right steps to improve the quality of the system. It is analogous to seeing _Weight_ as the only measure of improving health.


### Conclusion

Velocity should be treated as a guide using which you plan the next iteration, and measure the impact of your adjustments or fixes. Velocity also acts as an approximate tool to provide visibility into when certain features will make it into the release.

Velocity is _NOT_ a measure of the quality of the work being done by the team or of the productivity of the team.
